Introduction Session Demos
==========

This describes the demos used during the opening session of the Android Azure camp content.

# Prerequisites

1.  For the VM creation demo, you should already have some sort of VM created so you can walk through it's settings
2.  For the websites creation demo, you should already have some sort of website created so you can walk through it's settings (in case the website you generate takes too long to spin up)

# Demo: Azure Portal
 
1.  Go to [http://manage.windowsazure.com](http://manage.windowsazure.com)
2.  Talk about how the portal is the entry point for everything inside of Azure
3.  Highlight the navigation area on the left side.
4.  Show the subscription drop down, explain that everything you create is tied to a subscription
5.  Point out the portal is designed around different components (i.e. VMs vs Websites vs Databases, etc) as opposed to whole applications (i.e. this app is composed of this VM, this DB, this Website, etc)
6.  Mention that there is also a preview portal which moves towards this holistic application model
